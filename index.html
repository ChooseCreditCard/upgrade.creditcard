          Banks often invite you to “upgrade” to a premium or higher-tier card with more perks.
          This page explains what really changes when you upgrade — fees, insurance, lounge access,
          rewards and how it may affect your credit profile.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card Upgrade?</h2>
      <p>
        An upgrade usually means moving from a basic or mid-tier card to a higher-tier version
        with more benefits — for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>airport lounge access or better lounge network coverage,</li>
        <li>stronger travel insurance and purchase protections,</li>
        <li>higher or more flexible rewards rates,</li>
        <li>status with airlines or hotels,</li>
        <li>Concierge, credits or statement rebates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many markets, “upgrade” can happen via a <strong>product change</strong> with the same issuer,
        meaning your account history may stay intact while the card type changes.  
        In other cases, an upgrade is effectively a <strong>new application</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- When it makes sense -->
    <section id="when" class="section">
      <h2>When an Upgrade Can Be Worth It</h2>
      <p>
        Upgrading is rarely about shiny metal or card color — it’s about whether the new benefits
        are worth the extra annual fee and potential FX or usage costs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Situations where an upgrade may make sense</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You travel several times a year and will actually use lounges and insurance.</li>
        <li>Your spending naturally lines up with bonus categories (travel, dining, groceries).</li>
        <li>You can meet minimum spend thresholds without overspending.</li>
        <li>You value airline or hotel status more than a lower annual fee.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Situations where staying on a basic card is safer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You carry a balance and interest cost matters more than perks.</li>
        <li>You travel rarely and would not use lounge or status perks.</li>
        <li>You prefer simple cashback and low or no annual fee.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Upgrade Requests, Credit Checks & Account History</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on issuer and country, an upgrade can involve a fresh credit check or simply an
        internal review of your existing account.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some issuers treat upgrades as <strong>product changes</strong>, keeping account age the same.</li>
        <li>Others may open a new account and close the old one, which can affect your profile.</li>
        <li>Credit limits may increase, decrease or stay flat depending on risk appetite.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always ask how the upgrade will be reported, whether the old line will remain on file,
        and how any welcome bonus or new-fee structure will be applied.
