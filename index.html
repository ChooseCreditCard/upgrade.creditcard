    <!-- What is a card upgrade? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What is a credit-card upgrade?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        A card upgrade is any change that moves your account to a “higher” level: more benefits, higher limits,
        different reward structures or a more premium product. Sometimes the bank suggests it, sometimes you
        request it.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Limit increase</strong> – your credit limit is raised after review.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier or product upgrade</strong> – you move from a basic to a premium version of the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards upgrade</strong> – better earn-rates or benefits in exchange for higher fees or usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Status upgrade</strong> – you qualify for elite or “gold/platinum” tiers based on spend or history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        “Upgrade” always sounds positive, but it can also mean higher fees, more temptation to spend and
        more complex terms. The details matter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How upgrades work -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How card upgrades & limit increases work</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Behind any card upgrade there is a risk and profitability decision by the issuer. A typical upgrade
        or limit-increase flow looks like this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Eligibility check</strong> – payment history, utilisation, income and internal scores
          are reviewed.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Offer or request</strong> – the bank either pre-approves an upgrade or you apply for one
          via app, web or customer service.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Credit assessment</strong> – sometimes a “soft” check, sometimes a full credit check,
          depending on jurisdiction and change size.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Decision &amp; mapping</strong> – your account is mapped to a new product, tier or limit.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Card reissue &amp; terms</strong> – you may receive a new card, new terms and updated fee
          or reward structures.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Reporting &amp; history</strong> – how the upgrade appears on your credit file varies by
          country and issuer (product change vs new account).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The best upgrades improve your flexibility and benefits without destabilising your budget or damaging
        your long-term credit profile.
      </p>

    <!-- Types / models of upgrades -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common types of card upgrade paths</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Different issuers design different upgrade ladders. These are some of the most common patterns:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Limit-only increases</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Your product stays the same, but the credit limit grows as you build history. Useful if your income
            has increased or spending needs have changed – but watch utilisation and temptation to overspend.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Product changes within a family</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Moving from a basic to a plus or premium version of the same card family, often keeping the same
            account history but adding fees and benefits.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Secured to unsecured upgrades</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards backed by a deposit can be upgraded to unsecured credit after a track record of on-time
            payments, sometimes releasing the deposit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Rewards &amp; travel tier upgrades</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Moving to cards with higher earn-rates, lounge access, insurance or travel perks, usually with
            higher annual fees and stricter eligibility.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Portfolio &amp; migration upgrades</h3>
          <p class="small">
            When a bank shuts down or refreshes old products, existing cardholders can be migrated to a newer
            card design with upgraded features.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Business &amp; professional upgrades</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards that evolve with your income or business size, offering higher limits, more reporting and
            dedicated support as you grow.
