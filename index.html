    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card “Upgrade”?</h2>
      <p>
        An upgrade usually means moving from an entry-level or mid-tier card to a more premium version with stronger
        benefits: better earn rates, lounge access, richer insurance or enhanced service. In many cases this is done as a
        “product change” within the same issuer, rather than applying for a completely new card.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the user side, the card number, account history or credit line may stay the same, while the features,
        pricing and branding change. The specific mechanics depend on how the issuer structures its portfolio.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Upgrade Offers Are Typically Triggered</h2>
      <p>
        Issuers look at several signals when deciding whom to invite for an upgrade: consistent on-time payments,
        sufficient income, stable usage patterns and sometimes overall relationship value across products. Targeted
        upgrade campaigns may appear via email, app messages or account dashboards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some upgrades are customer-initiated: you contact the issuer to request a move to a higher tier. Others are
        pre-approved offers with simplified processes. In both cases, terms and fee changes should be disclosed clearly
        before you accept.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits & trade-offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What You Gain – and What You Might Give Up</h2>
      <p>
        Premium cards often add perks such as airport lounge access, stronger travel insurance, concierge services,
        purchase protections and higher reward earn on specific categories. These benefits can be valuable for frequent
        travellers or heavy users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trade-off is usually higher annual fees, stricter eligibility criteria and sometimes more complex terms.
        Not every upgrade increases real-world value; it depends on how closely the benefits match your spending and
        travel pattern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Practical considerations -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Practical Considerations Before You Upgrade</h2>
      <p>
        Before accepting an upgrade, it helps to check:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>• Whether the new fee structure still makes sense over a full year.</li>
        <li>• If benefits overlap with other cards you already hold.</li>
        <li>• How rewards, points or miles balances are handled during the switch.</li>
        <li>• Whether existing instalment plans, promotions or welcome bonuses are affected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For some cardholders, downgrading later is possible if the benefits no longer justify the price, but terms
        differ between issuers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risk & profile -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Impact on Credit Profile and Account History</h2>
      <p>
        Product-change style upgrades usually keep the same account open, preserving age and history, while changing
        features and fees. Opening a brand new premium card instead may create a new account and hard inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuers may adjust credit limits upward for certain upgrades, reflecting higher expected spend. This can improve
        utilisation ratios if managed carefully, but may also tempt overuse if budgets are not monitored.
